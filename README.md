# Orion Protocol: Cross-Chain Rebase Token & Vault

## Overview
Unleash the power of elastic finance with the Orion Protocol. üí´ This innovative project features a cross-chain compatible rebase token (OrionToken) that dynamically adjusts its supply to reward users with accrued interest. Coupled with a secure Vault contract, it incentivizes deposits and provides a robust framework for managing digital assets with built-in access control and a decreasing interest rate mechanism, fueling the next generation of DeFi liquidity across chains!

## Features
- **Elastic Token Supply**: The OrionToken implements a rebase mechanism where its supply dynamically adjusts to reflect accrued interest.
- **Accrued Interest**: Users' balances grow over time based on a set interest rate, which is minted to them upon any interaction (mint, burn, transfer).
- **User-Specific Interest Rates**: Each user's interest rate is locked in at the time of their deposit or interaction, allowing for personalized and consistent growth.
- **Controlled Interest Rate Adjustment**: The global interest rate can only be decreased by the contract owner, ensuring a controlled and potentially deflationary incentive structure.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Leverages OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` for secure management of critical functions, such as minting and burning.
- **Secure ETH Vault**: A dedicated `Vault` contract seamlessly handles ETH deposits and withdrawals, maintaining a 1:1 peg with the OrionToken.
- **Cross-Chain Design**: Architectural considerations for future cross-chain compatibility and liquidity solutions.

## API Documentation

The Orion Protocol consists of two primary smart contracts: `OrionToken` and `Vault`. Interaction with the protocol involves calling functions on these deployed contracts.

### Contract Addresses
After deployment, you will obtain the addresses for the `OrionToken` and `Vault` contracts. These addresses serve as the entry points for all protocol interactions.

### Endpoints (Contract Functions)

## Usage

After deploying the `OrionToken` and `Vault` contracts to an Ethereum-compatible network, you can interact with them programmatically or through tools like Foundry's `cast` or `forge script`.

1.  **Deployment (Example using Foundry)**:
    First, ensure your `.env` file is configured with `RPC_URL` and `PRIVATE_KEY`.
    Deploy `OrionToken`:
    ```bash
    forge create src/OrionToken.sol:OrionToken --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```
    Note the deployed `OrionToken` address.
    
    Then, deploy `Vault`, passing the `OrionToken` address:
    ```bash
    forge create src/Vault.sol:Vault --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --constructor-args <ORION_TOKEN_ADDRESS>
    ```
    Note the deployed `Vault` address.

2.  **Granting Mint/Burn Role to Vault**:
    The `Vault` needs the `MINT_AND_BURN_ROLE` to mint and burn `OrionToken`. The `OrionToken` owner (the deployer) must grant this role:
    ```bash
    cast send <ORION_TOKEN_ADDRESS> "grantMintAndBurnRole(address)" <VAULT_ADDRESS> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

3.  **Depositing ETH into the Vault**:
    Any user can deposit ETH into the `Vault` to receive `OrionToken`:
    ```bash
    cast send <VAULT_ADDRESS> "deposit()" --value 1ether --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```
    This will mint 1 `OrionToken` (with its initial interest) to `msg.sender`.

4.  **Redeeming OrionToken from the Vault**:
    A user can burn their `OrionToken` to receive ETH back:
    ```bash
    cast send <VAULT_ADDRESS> "redeem(uint256)" <AMOUNT_TO_REDEEM_SCALED_BY_1e18> --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```
    To redeem all tokens:
    ```bash
    cast send <VAULT_ADDRESS> "redeem(uint256)" $(cast call <ORION_TOKEN_ADDRESS> "balanceOf(address)" $(cast wallet address) --rpc-url $RPC_URL) --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
    ```

5.  **Checking Balances**:
    To check the total balance of a user (including accrued interest):
    ```bash
    cast call <ORION_TOKEN_ADDRESS> "balanceOf(address)" <USER_ADDRESS> --rpc-url $RPC_URL
    ```
    To check the principal balance (initial minted amount):
    ```bash
    cast call <ORION_TOKEN_ADDRESS> "principleBalanceOf(address)" <USER_ADDRESS> --rpc-url $RPC_URL
    ```
