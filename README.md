## Overview ‚ú®
The **OrionToken** project implements an innovative cross-chain rebase (elastic) token using **Solidity** and the **Foundry** development framework. This smart contract is designed to dynamically adjust user balances through an interest rate mechanism, incentivizing participation and rewarding long-term holders. It integrates with **OpenZeppelin Contracts** for robust and secure ERC20 functionalities.

## Features üöÄ
*   **Elastic Supply**: Token supply rebases based on a globally set interest rate.
*   **Dynamic Interest Rate**: Allows the contract owner to set a global interest rate that can only decrease, ensuring predictable value accrual.
*   **User-Specific Interest Rates**: Users' accrued interest is calculated based on the global rate at their last interaction (deposit, transfer, burn).
*   **Accrued Interest Minting**: Automatically mints accrued interest to users upon significant interactions (mint, burn, transfer), reflecting their updated balance.
*   **Standard ERC20 Compliance**: Extends OpenZeppelin's `ERC20` contract, ensuring full compatibility with ERC20 standards.
*   **Cross-Chain Capability**: Designed with cross-chain transfers in mind, allowing for burning on one chain and minting on another to maintain supply consistency.

## Getting Started ‚öôÔ∏è

### Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/olujimiAdebakin/cross_chain_rebase-token_contract.git
    cd cross_chain_rebase-token_contract
    ```

2.  **Install Foundry**:
    If you don't have Foundry installed, run:
    ```bash
    curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    foundryup
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**:
    The project uses Git submodules for OpenZeppelin contracts and Forge Standard Library.
    ```bash
    forge install
    ```
    This command initializes and updates the submodules specified in `.gitmodules`.

4.  **Build the Project**:
    Compile the smart contracts:
    ```bash
    forge build
    ```

### Environment Variables
This specific smart contract currently does not require any environment variables for local development or testing. However, for deployment to a blockchain network, you would typically need:

*   `PRIVATE_KEY`: The private key of the deployer wallet. (e.g., `0x...`)
*   `RPC_URL`: The RPC endpoint URL for the blockchain network. (e.g., `https://rpc.sepolia.org`)

## Contract Functions üìñ

### `constructor()`
Initializes the ERC20 token with "Orion Token" as its name and "ORT" as its symbol.

### `setInterestRate(uint256 _newInterestRate)`
**Description**: Sets the global interest rate for the token. This function can only decrease the current interest rate. Access control mechanisms (e.g., `onlyOwner` or a governance module) should be added for production environments to restrict who can call this function.

**Parameters**:
*   `_newInterestRate` (uint256): The new interest rate to set (e.g., `5e16` for 5%).

**Errors**:
*   `OrionToken_InterestRateCanOnlyDecrease`: If `_newInterestRate` is greater than the current `s_interestRate`.

### `principleBalanceOf(address _user)`
**Description**: Returns the principle balance of a user, which represents the tokens actually minted to them, excluding any accrued interest.

**Parameters**:
*   `_user` (address): The address of the user.

**Returns**:
*   `uint256`: The principle balance of the user.

### `mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)`
**Description**: Mints new tokens to a specified address. This function also triggers the minting of any accrued interest for the recipient and locks in the current global interest rate for them.

**Parameters**:
*   `_to` (address): The address to mint tokens to.
*   `_amount` (uint256): The principal amount of tokens to mint.

**Errors**:
*   `Amount must be greater than zero`: If `_amount` is 0.
*   `Cannot mint to the zero address`: If `_to` is `address(0)`.

### `burn(address _from, uint256 _amount)`
**Description**: Burns tokens from a user's balance. This function automatically handles burning the entire balance if `_amount` is `type(uint256).max`. It also mints any accrued interest for the user before burning.

**Parameters**:
*   `_from` (address): The address from which to burn tokens.
*   `_amount` (uint256): The amount of tokens to burn. Use `type(uint256).max` to burn the entire balance.

### `balanceOf(address _user)`
**Description**: Returns the current balance of an account, *including* any accrued interest since the last update. This overrides the standard ERC20 `balanceOf` to provide the elastic token's total balance.

**Parameters**:
*   `_user` (address): The address of the account.

**Returns**:
*   `uint256`: The total balance of the user, including accrued interest.

### `transfer(address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`
**Description**: Transfers tokens from the caller to a recipient. Before the transfer, accrued interest for both the sender and recipient is minted. If the recipient is new (has no prior interest rate set), they inherit the sender's interest rate.

**Parameters**:
*   `_recipient` (address): The address to transfer tokens to.
*   `_amount` (uint256): The amount of tokens to transfer. Can be `type(uint256).max` to transfer the full balance.

**Returns**:
*   `bool`: `true` if the transfer was successful.

### `transferFrom(address _sender, address _recipient, uint256 _amount)`
**Description**: Transfers tokens from one address to another on behalf of the `msg.sender`, provided an allowance has been approved. Similar to `transfer`, accrued interest for both sender and recipient is minted before the transfer, and new recipients inherit the sender's interest rate.

**Parameters**:
*   `_sender` (address): The address to transfer tokens from.
*   `_recipient` (address): The address to transfer tokens to.
*   `_amount` (uint256): The amount of tokens to transfer. Can be `type(uint256).max` to transfer the full balance.

**Returns**:
*   `bool`: `true` if the transfer was successful.

### `getInterestRate()`
**Description**: Retrieves the current global interest rate set for the token.

**Returns**:
*   `uint256`: The current global interest rate.

### `getUserInterestRate(address _user)`
**Description**: Retrieves the specific interest rate that was locked in for a given user at their last interaction.

**Parameters**:
*   `_user` (address): The address of the user.

**Returns**:
*   `uint256`: The user's specific locked-in interest rate.
